# hello-world
My first repository

Hello there i'm Renato Lima Neves, an newbie Web Developer. I decided to create a github account to share my projcts so i can have my first job as a web developer. So far i've learned CSS3, HTML5 and a little bit of JS. 
When i'm not coding i'm either, reading a book or playing Brawlhalla. I'm always willing to learn and work hard, so i can improve more.
If you want to help me give me your feedback on my projects.
